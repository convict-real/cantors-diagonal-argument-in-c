This is a simple representation of Cantor's Diagnal Argument, written in C.

The idea of this argument, is that there are more combinations of decimal places between 0 and 1 than all real numbers that exist. This is because with real numbers, it is technically countable, because there is a largest number,
even if you cant count up to it within your lifetime. However, the combinations of decimal places between 0 and 1 are uncountable, because you can always just add another 0, and then you have to start again.

DISCLAIMER: The only issue with this project, is that it is counting an uncountable infinite amount of decimal places, and in this code, it only goes down to 5 decimal places, but it gives you a general idea.
